# resumegenerator1.0
This is an automatic resume generation tool I wrote for a team of researchers. It takes in names, emails, addresses, and personal data stored in .txt format and outputs 100 fake resumes with with different demographics, professional experiences, and content.

How to run Resume Generator 1.0:

  1. Download this repository 
  2. unzip Project.zip
  3. Place the Main, Reader, Resume, and Fabricator.java files into the the Project folder
  4. Complile all java files, and run Main.class

How to edit source information:
  All emails follow this specific format, with few exceptions:
    name + second initial + date of birth (i.e. "011297") + @gmail.com
  You can edit any of the source files (stored in .txt files) to change the content of each resume.
 
How to set the University:
  This will be done by editing the Main.java file.
